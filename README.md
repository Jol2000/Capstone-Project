# Capstone-Project

Project

Treasure It is a recent start-up company founded by Alex Tillcak, itâ€™s a personal cataloguing service that aims
to give everyone access to simple, flexible and affordable cataloguing solutions. The company, Treasure It,
operates in the software and technology sector, this means our project is software-based, specifically, it's the
development of a desktop application that not only simplifies the process of building and managing an
individual's personal database, but also versatile enough to handle a diverse range of physical and
information based assets. Furthermore, the cataloguing desktop application we are developing, enables
users to meticulously organise their cherished collections, whether they be trading cards, precious dinosaur
bones, or sensitive documents. Users can effortlessly upload images of their prized possessions, and where
applicable, attach purchase receipts or proof of ownership, enhancing the integrity of their digital archive.
The software also offers the flexibility to add custom tags and fields, allowing users to easily distinguish and
categorise their collections with precision
